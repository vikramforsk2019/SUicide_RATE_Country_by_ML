Project 01:

This Suicide-Rate dataset has 27820 number of observations (rows) and 12
features (columns). One thing that is obvious is the HDI for year feature
has a large number of missing value and hence it wouldn't be considered
later on.

Description of features:

1. country: country name

101 unique value

2. year: years

ranged between 1985 - 2016

3. sex: gender

female or male

4. age: age groups

5-14 years

15-24 years

25-34 years

5. suicides_no: number of suicide cases in the given country, year, sex and
age group

6. population: number of population

7. suicides/100k pop: suicide rate normalized by population number

8. country-year: country name + year

9. HDI for year: The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistical
composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income
indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human

Find out the following:



1. visualize the  number of suicides of both male and females of different
age group for every year from 1986-2016

   & find which age group has the highest number of suside rate.

2. Which country has the highest number of Suside rate visualize it.

3. Which country has highest & Lowest suside rate in 2006 visualize it.

4. apply all classification algorithm and find best results,check the score
and accuracy.then predict for this data

   country ----> Albania

   year ----> 2014

   Sex ----> Male

   Age ----> 24

   Suside no. ----> 22

   population ----> 279800

   country-year ----> 7.11

   gdp_for_year ($)  ---->2,10,56,21,800

   gdp_per_capita ($)  ---->749

   according to data find it was lie on which generation.

5. Which country has the lowest GDP rate in 2014. visualize it.
